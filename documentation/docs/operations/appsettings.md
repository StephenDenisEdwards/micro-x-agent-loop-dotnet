# Configuration Reference

Configuration is split into two files:

- **`.env`** — secrets (API keys), loaded by DotNetEnv
- **`appsettings.json`** — application settings, loaded by Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration

## Secrets (`.env`)

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Yes | Anthropic API key for Claude |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | No | Google OAuth client ID for Gmail tools |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | No | Google OAuth client secret for Gmail tools |

If `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` or `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` is missing, Gmail tools are not registered. All other tools work normally.

## App Settings (`appsettings.json`)

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `Model` | string | `"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"` | Claude model ID to use |
| `MaxTokens` | int | `8192` | Maximum tokens per API response |
| `Temperature` | decimal | `1.0` | Sampling temperature (0.0 = deterministic, 1.0 = creative) |
| `MaxToolResultChars` | int | `40000` | Maximum characters per tool result before truncation |
| `MaxConversationMessages` | int | `50` | Maximum messages in conversation history before trimming |
| `DocumentsDirectory` | string | _(none)_ | Fallback directory for resolving relative file paths |

### Example

```json
{
  "Model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
  "MaxTokens": 8192,
  "Temperature": 1.0,
  "MaxToolResultChars": 40000,
  "MaxConversationMessages": 50,
  "DocumentsDirectory": "C:\\Users\\you\\documents"
}
```

All settings are optional — sensible defaults are used when a setting is missing.

## Setting Details

### Model

The Anthropic model ID. Common values:

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` | Good balance of capability and cost |
| `claude-opus-4-6` | Most capable, higher cost |
| `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | Fastest, lowest cost |

### MaxTokens

Controls the maximum length of Claude's response. Higher values allow longer responses but use more of your rate limit budget.

### Temperature

Controls randomness in Claude's responses:
- `0.0` — most deterministic, best for factual/precise tasks
- `1.0` — default, good general-purpose balance
- Values above 1.0 increase randomness

### MaxToolResultChars

When a tool returns more than this many characters, the output is truncated and a message is appended:

```
[OUTPUT TRUNCATED: Showing 40,000 of 85,000 characters from read_file]
```

A warning is also printed to stderr. Set to `0` to disable truncation.

### MaxConversationMessages

When the conversation history exceeds this count, the oldest messages are removed. A note is printed to stderr:

```
Note: Conversation history trimmed — removed 2 oldest message(s) to stay within the 50 message limit
```

This helps prevent rate limit errors from growing context. Set to `0` to disable trimming.

### DocumentsDirectory

When `read_file` receives a relative path that doesn't exist at the current working directory or anywhere up to the repo root, it tries resolving it relative to this directory. Also tries matching just the filename within the directory.

Use an absolute path for reliability. Relative paths are resolved from the current working directory.
